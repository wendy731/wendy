i need answer for this. Please help me
The factorial of a non-negative integer  𝑛  is expressed recursively by:
$$
n! = 
\begin{cases}
1 & n = 0 \\
(n - 1)! \,n & n > 0
\end{cases}
$$
 
Develop a function named factorial for computing the factorial using recursion. Test your function against the math.factorial function, e.g.
